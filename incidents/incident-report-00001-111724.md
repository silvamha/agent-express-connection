# Incident Report #00001
Date: November 17, 2024
Type: Application Stability Issue
Status: Resolved

## Issue Description
Persistent application instability issues manifesting as:
1. Port conflicts between Express server and existing processes
2. Vite development server termination
3. Message handling inconsistencies in Mistral AI chat interface

## Root Causes
1. **Port Conflict**
   - Express server attempting to use port 3005 without handling conflicts
   - No graceful fallback mechanism for busy ports
   - Multiple server instances potentially running simultaneously

2. **Message Handling**
   - Inconsistent message format between client and server
   - Improper conversation history management
   - System message integration issues

3. **Process Management**
   - Inadequate process cleanup between server restarts
   - Nodemon watching causing cascading restarts
   - Lack of proper error handling in server startup

## Impact
- Application instability
- Repeated server crashes
- Default responses from Mistral AI ("Hello! How can I assist you today?")
- Poor user experience due to service interruptions

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Server Port Management
```javascript
function startServer(port) {
    try {
        app.listen(port, () => {
            console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
        }).on('error', (err) => {
            if (err.code === 'EADDRINUSE') {
                console.log(`Port ${port} is busy, trying ${port + 1}`);
                startServer(port + 1);
            }
        });
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Failed to start server:', err);
    }
}
```

### 2. Vite Configuration Enhancement
- Added robust proxy error handling
- Implemented request/response logging
- Enhanced stability through proper proxy configuration

### 3. Message Handling Improvements
- Standardized message format between client and server
- Implemented proper conversation history management
- Fixed system message integration

### 4. Process Management
- Implemented proper process cleanup
- Added error event handlers
- Enhanced logging for debugging

## Preventive Measures
1. **Port Management**
   - Automatic port conflict resolution
   - Enhanced error logging
   - Graceful fallback mechanism

2. **Application Architecture**
   - Improved message format validation
   - Better state management
   - Enhanced error boundaries

3. **Development Environment**
   - Clear process management procedures
   - Better development scripts
   - Enhanced logging and monitoring

## Lessons Learned
1. **Port Management**
   - Always implement graceful port conflict handling
   - Include proper error logging
   - Consider environment-specific port configuration

2. **State Management**
   - Maintain consistent message formats
   - Implement proper validation
   - Consider message history limitations

3. **Development Process**
   - Implement proper process cleanup
   - Enhance monitoring and logging
   - Document common issues and solutions

## Monitoring and Future Prevention
1. **Added Logging**
   ```javascript
   console.log('Received messages:', messages);
   console.log('Current message:', message);
   console.log('Formatted messages for Mistral:', JSON.stringify(formattedMessages, null, 2));
   console.log('Mistral API response:', JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
   ```

2. **Error Handling**
   - Enhanced error boundaries
   - Proper error reporting
   - User-friendly error messages

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated development setup procedures
   - Added troubleshooting guides
   - Documented common issues and solutions

## Related Changes
1. **Server Configuration**
   - Dynamic port assignment
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Improved logging

2. **Client Configuration**
   - Enhanced proxy setup
   - Better error handling
   - Improved state management

3. **Development Tools**
   - Updated npm scripts
   - Enhanced development workflow
   - Improved debugging capabilities

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate**
   - Monitor application stability
   - Review error logs regularly
   - Update documentation as needed

2. **Short-term**
   - Implement automated testing
   - Enhance error reporting
   - Improve user feedback

3. **Long-term**
   - Consider containerization
   - Implement health checks
   - Enhance monitoring capabilities

## Conclusion
The incident was successfully resolved through systematic debugging and implementation of robust error handling and port management. The application now handles port conflicts gracefully and maintains proper message handling, resulting in improved stability and user experience.
